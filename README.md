# Java on Azure

This repo intends to provide an overview of Java on Azure services, explanation, samples, etc.

## Introduction

Since Microsoft Azure is a platform that provides compute, storage and networking, it is neutral as to what runs on top of it: any operating system, app or db server, programming language, etc. This power of choice is clear when you look at the DevOps Starter in Azure: It lets you select a programming language (.NET, Node.js, PHP, Java, Static Website, Python, Ruby and Go), a framework and then an Azure service (VMs, Kubernetes, App Service or serverless function).
